									<br>
									<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has gripped the world and resulted in widespread disruption, with over 346 million cases and 5.5 million deaths as of January 2022. To combat the spread of the virus, many countries have implemented various strategies, including lockdowns, social distancing, and the use of vaccines.</p>
									<p>To address these challenges, a simulation using the SIR (Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered) model was developed to assess the impact of various containment and vaccination policies. The model incorporates data from the Philippines and simulates the spread of COVID-19 under different policy scenarios. The model takes into account several key variables, including the number of susceptible individuals, the number of infected individuals, and the number of recovered individuals. It also considers the impact of containment measures and vaccination programs. </p>
									<p>The simulation model is used to explore the potential impact of different vaccination and containment strategies in the Philippines. The results show that a combination of vaccination, containment, and mass testing can be effective in limiting the spread of the virus. The simulation results can provide valuable insights for policymakers in the Philippines and other countries facing similar challenges. By understanding the potential impact of different strategies, countries can make informed decisions on how to best respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

									<h1 class="card-title">Theoritical Basis</h1>
									<br>
									<p>The S-I-R model developed by Kermack and Mackendrick (1927) was modified by Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020). The simulation was inspired by Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020) model, with the difference of not taking into account the aggregate consumption and labor hours of the population. The S-I-R model operates in (i) the probability of getting infected (for those who are susceptible), (ii) the probability of recovering (recovery rate), and (iii) the probability of dying (fatality rate).
									</p>
									<p>Equation 1, showing the Tₜ equation (new infections per period). The parameter π refer to the probability of getting infected.</p>
                          			<p class="card-text">Equation 1. <img src="images\eq1.png" style="width: 6rem; height: 3rem;" alt="" /></p>
									<p>Borrowing the notations of Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020), we arrived at the following equations:</p>
									<img src="images\eq.png" style="width: 16rem; height: 13rem;" alt="" />
									<p>The containment policy or quarantine measures that people must follow can vary depending on the location and the specific circumstances. Generally speaking, quarantine involves isolating oneself from others in order to prevent the spread of disease. This may involve staying at home or in a designated quarantine facility for a certain period of time and avoiding contact with others. Quarantine measures may be mandatory or voluntary, and may be enforced by government authorities or self-imposed by individuals. The goal of quarantine measures is to slow down or stop the spread of disease and protect the health of the wider population.</p>
									<p>Figure 1. Evolution of business restrictions/containment policies (maximum capacities at which businesses can operate) in NCR, Philippines</p>
									<img src="images\f1.png" style="width: 40rem; height: 30rem;" alt="" />
									<p>Source: Basilio’s estimates (preliminary) using PSA’s Annual Survey of Business Establishments, the PSIC and National Income Accounts, based also on government directives such as IATF Resolutions, DTI Circulars, LTFRB issuances, among others.</p>
									<p class="card-text">Equation 5. <img src="images\eq5.png" style="width: 17rem; height: 3rem;" alt="" /></p>
									<p>The variable μt,k represents the containment measure per industry k over time where k = 1, ..., 18, representing the 18 industries listed in the equation above. Information sets about containment policies over time and by industry are represented using the Gt,j notation.</p>
									<p>Relating the containment rate, the parameter μt denotes the containment rate. And this simulation it is used to limit the movements of turtles. And we have a containment interval to account for the changes in the quarantine period.
									</p>
									<p>For the theoretical basis of the vaccination program, as stated in Basilio’s paper, the utility maximization problem of the vulnerable individuals in Eichenbaum, Rebelo, and Trabandt's (2020) macroeconomic model of a pandemic reflects vaccination as shown in the equation below.</p>
									<p class="card-text">Equation 6. <img src="images\eqvac.png" style="width: 40rem; height: 3rem;" alt="" /></p>
									<p>The period t utility that an individual derives through regular consumption and employment decisions or activities is represented by the first term of the equation. The second and third terms relate to potential health conditions for the sensitive person throughout the next period (t + 1). If the person does not get vaccinated (with a probability of δv), they will either continue to be susceptible or contract the disease. If the person is vaccinated, they join the group that has "recovered" or is “immune” since the vaccinated person never contracts the disease again, at least throughout the pandemic time.</p>
									<p>Inspired by this, we have this model for an S-I-R with a vaccination program where we consider the last term of equation 6. Our model as shown in Figure 2 below, shows that a susceptible will become immune if it passes through the vaccination zone or gets vaccinated. On the other hand if a susceptible will not get vaccinated but get close to the infected this will turn the susceptible to becoming infected and with the fatality-rate and recovery-rate will either be dead or immune.</p>
